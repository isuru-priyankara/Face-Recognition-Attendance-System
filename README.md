# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
Face Recognition Attendance System(arduino/python)

This is a facial recognition based attendance system using ESP32 CAM module.

In this project, an attendance system based on face recognition is created using ESP32 CAM and Python.
In this attendance system, we will not only identify the person, but also store the information of the detected person in a Microsoft Excel file. Moreover, the time period they stayed in the frame was also recorded in an excel sheet.
